This is a collection of algorithms and data structures I create while
preparing myself for a interview. It contains everything they
say I should prepare. 

So far the structures use key as the value but I expect to have time
in the near future to make them templates. So far it includes:

- Binary Tree 

- Red Black Binary Tree

- Insertion sort, Quick sort, Merge sort and Heap sort

- A heap priority Queue which I myself find quite useless (the only
  element contained is the key used to order it).

- A Hash table. It uses strings as keys and integers as values.

The code compiles with MS VC++ 2010 Express and with g++ 4.5 using 
the compiler flag -std=gnu++0x (In order to support lambda
funcionts). Actually, the only C++0x feature that it uses is lambda
functions (which I consider probably the most important addition to C++).
